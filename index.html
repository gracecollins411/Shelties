<h1>My Dogs</h1>
<p>I have three dogs and they are all shelties. Their names are Izze, Sierra, and Hudson.</p>
<h2>Izze</h2>
<p>Some facts about Izze:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Izze is the first child of all three dogs.</li> 
  <li>We got her in 2009 and she is now 11 years old.</li>
  <li>She's a tri sheltie which means she is black, white, and a little brown.</li>
  <li>She is named after the Pepsi drink "Izze" (pronouced "Izzy") because my dad works for Pepsi and people constantly think we're just spelling her name wrong.</li>
  <li>She used to run away all the time so we got a fenced in yard.</li>
  <li>She's one of the most loving dogs you'll ever meet.</li>
  <li>She gives lots of kisses despite her bad breath.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is a picture of her:</p>

<h2>Sierra</h2>
<p>Some facts about Sierra:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Sierra is the middle child of all three dogs.</li>
  <li>We got her in 2014 and she is now 6 years old.</li>
  <li>She's a blue merle sheltie which means she kind of looks like an Australian Shephard.</li>
  <li>She is named after the Pepsi drink "Sierra Mist".</li>
  <li>She definitely has undiagnosed anxiety because she's nervous all the time.</li>
  <li>When she's not anxious she loves to play with her brother and sister.</li>
  <li>She's a really weird dog, but we love her any way.</li>

<h2>Hudson</h2>
<p>Some facts about Hudson:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Hudson is the baby of the family.</li>
  <li>We got him in April of 2020 and is almost a year old.</li>
  <li>He's a sable sheltie which means he looks like Lassie.</li>
  <li>He wasn't really named after anything, we just happened to pass the Hudson River around the time we got him and thought it was a cool name.</li>
  <li>We planned to get him while I was away at school so I wasn't really ever supposed to be with him that much, but he ended up turning into a quarantine puppy.</li>
  <li>The day we got him he got 1 million views on TikTok and now has 30k followers.</li>
  <li>He's so friendly and loves almost everyone.</li>
  <li>He also loves to cuddle and slept with me every night when I was home.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is a picture of him when we first got him:</p>

<p>While being at school I really miss my dogs because they bring so much light to my life with all of their personalities and fluff.</p>
<p>This is a picture of all of them from the other day when it snowed:</p>
